## About Me

I am Pranav Durai, a Computer Vision Engineer at OpenCV. I'm a passionate Quantum AI Researcher, and currently, I serve as a Research Fellow at Stanford University - School of Medicine, focusing on pre-clinical medical imaging and segmentation. My love for nature led me to explore its wonders, traveling thousands of kilometers on my motorcycle in search of self-discovery. As an enthusiastic Apple fan, I have been devotedly following the company since 2010. My mission is to contribute to humanity's sustainable future through my work. 

DARE MIGHTY THINGS ðŸš€
